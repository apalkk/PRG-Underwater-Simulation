# Underwater-Robotics
Ongoing project 

## Tasks
- [x] 2D bounding Box of objects from Blender `2.93`
- [x] Integrate IMU with blender
- [x] Integrate LiDAR/SONAR with blender
- [x] Train yolo on the generated data from blender
- [ ] Rover position data with detections on PCL

## Google Colab Notebook
* colab notebook used to train the yolov4-tiny, find it [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RePfSTb7c1tPAuh_D-ySLhrG78gxkF9D?usp=sharing)
* Modified the colab notebook provided [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_GdoqCJWXsChrOiY8sZMr_zbr_fH-0Fg)

## Models
* We trained a yoloV4-tiny on a dataset of around 5000 images
